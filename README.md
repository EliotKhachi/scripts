#bash-scripts

This project is used to store and maintain all of my bash scripts. Some of them are extremely customized and others may be useful in general applications.

## Overview of Scripts

---
## zet
This script is a zettelkasten script written by my good friend and exceptional Linux King, Michael Arnold. You can find his github here: [MichaelArnold's Github](https://github.com/michaelarn0ld/michaelarn0ld)
The script is used to take notes on your computer using the zettelkasten method, a form of notetaking developed by Niklas Luhmann wherein notes aren't structured in folders nor contain a lot of information; rather, notes link to each other in a web of thought and each note is bite-sized and easily digestible. You can read more about it here [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), and learn how Michael intends it to be used here: [Michael's Bash Scripts](https://gitlab.com/michaelarn0ld/bash-scripts-macos)

## setupPC
This script is a customized script I use to boot-up my computer back to its original settings and packages in case of a system wipe.
